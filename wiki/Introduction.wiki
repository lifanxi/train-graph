#summary Introduction of this project

= Introduction =

This project aims to implement a cross-platform train graph drawing software. By inputting the information of the train lines and trains, the software can draw train graph automatically. At the same time, it can simulate the train running status by animations. 

This project originally named as "ETRC" and was published as close-source shareware. It was developed by LGuo, and can be obtained from the BBS of Hasea (One of the biggest railfan forum in China).

This project will be developed using Java, which is good for cross-platform support.

= History = 

Before ETRC decided to be open-sourced, this project was planned to be an free software project developing the train graph software from scratch using C++ and GTK. On Jun 1, 2009, the original developer of ETRC - LGuo - decided to make ETRC free software, thus this project is converted to be the home of ETRC.
